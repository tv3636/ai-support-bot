        "body": "One of the major advantages of leveraging Reservoir\u2019s NFT marketplace engine is that applications can embed marketplace functionality into their apps without it being a primary focus for the developers. \n\n**Core Benefits**\n\n- Add marketplace functionality without building any backend infrastructure\n- Access Reservoir\u2019s open orderbook, including liquidity aggregated from all major marketplaces\n- Control the fees of the orders on your site to generate revenue\n- Leverage Reservoir\u2019s ReservoirKit to get out-of-the-box checkout UI\n\nMarketplace functionality is _not_ just for teams building marketplaces. Reservoir supports a variety of applications with embedded marketplace functionality, including:\n\n- Wallets\n- Social\n- Explorer\n- Portfolio Apps\n\n## How to embed marketplace functionality into your app.\n\nTo most effectively leverage Reservoir to embed buying, bidding, listing, or selling into your application, we recommend you user either:\n\n- [Reservoir SDK (JS/TS/Node)](doc:reservoir-sdk): An abstracted SDK for interacting with the NFT market. All the function of the Reservoir API wrapped into easily-to-use, performant methods.\n- [ReservoirKit UI (React)](doc:reservoirkit-ui): a react library that makes it easy to add marketplace functionality and UI into your project.\n\nReservoirKit is a react library that wraps the Reservoir SDK, so its less of a choice between these two and more a choice of whether you would like to use UI kit components in your application.\n\n> \ud83d\udcd8 [Learn more about our supported marketplaces](https://docs.reservoir.tools/docs/supported-marketplaces)\n\n> \ud83d\udcd8 [Quick Start: Add Buying](https://docs.reservoir.tools/docs/buying)\n\n> \ud83d\udcd8 [Quick Start: Add Instant Sell](https://docs.reservoir.tools/docs/add-instant-sell)",
