If you try to purchase from other marketplaces, we will break it into multiple transactions\n- Features like normalizing royalties or collecting fees on top are not possible, because they require usage of the Reservoir Router contract\n- If you accept an offer, you'll receive Blur Pool ETH, not ETH or WETH in your wallet, which needs to be withdrawn in a separate transaction\n\nWe do our best to abstract these limitations from end users and developers, making the experience as seamless as possible.\n\nHopefully over time Blur will be upgraded, and some of these limitations removed.",
